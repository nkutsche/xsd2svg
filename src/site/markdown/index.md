# XSD2SVG Content Model Graphic API

This project provides an XSLT API to generate SVG Content Model Graphics for XSD components.

## Intention

In professional schema documentations it is a main feature to have for each component of the schema a graphical representation of the content model of the component, so that the reader can illustrate the usage of the component at a glance.

A graphical representation can be simple, if the component has a simple content model. If the conent model is very complex the graphical representation helps to get an overview of it.

This library should help to create awesome schema documentations with nice graphics for the content models.

In the following you will find some simple and a more complex example.

### Simple Element with Attributes
